## üèô City list application

This project is a city list application where you can add cities to the list of destinations.\
It was written in Typescript and was also tested with @testing-library/react.\
I Used the React Context and custom hooks to register and retrieve destinations from local storage.\
And I introduced the design system Ant Design to make it responsive.
